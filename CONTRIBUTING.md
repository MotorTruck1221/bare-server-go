# Contributing

- Contributing is welcome and very much appreciated! 

## How to contribute

- Fork the repository
- Create a branch with your changes (the `main` branch is protected, so you can't push directly to it)
- Commit and push your changes
- Create a pull request

## Want to contribute but don't know where to start?

- Check the [issues](http://github.com/ruby-network/bare-go/issues) for any open issues (or maybe even closed ones) that you can help with
- Check the [TODO](https://github.com/ruby-network/bare-go/?tab=readme-ov-file#todo) list for any tasks that you can help with
- Add a router (net/http, fiber, gin, etc)
