# Bare Server GO

- This is a complete bare server written in GO that is compliant with the [TompHTTP Server Specifications](https://github.com/tomphttp/specifications)

***NOTE: Unfinished*** *I skimmed the spec and wrote this only in a few hours. There are lots of unimplemented features and bugs. (and it's curtrently not very TOMP compatible)*
