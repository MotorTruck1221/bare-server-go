### This lists the available pre-built binaries for the current release. The binaries are available for the following platforms and architectures:

- Windows (64-bit)
- macOS (64-bit)
- macOS (ARM64)
- Linux (64-bit)
- Linux (ARM)
- Linux (ARM64)
- Linux (32-bit)

You can download the binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/tomphttp/bare-server-go/releases)
